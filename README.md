# Storybuilding

This is a quick, simple tool for a vaguely RP-ish game my partner and I like to play. We used to use paper & pens but we keep losing our pens.

The general idea is that each person controls a character that interacts with situations generated collaboratively. 

The rules are:

One person adds a bunch of nouns (or phrases that can go in the place of nous, for eg. incredibly deadly viper, rickety wheel, or fashionably attired mongoose) 

The other person adds sentences with holes for those nouns (for eg. The ____ was so, so big, and immediately, our attentions were turned to it). 

Once setup is done, the rounds go like this: 

1. Pull out a random sentence
2. If this is round 1, Person A uses that to start the story, if not, they work it into the existing story. They end on something their character does to address the situation and roll a d6.
3. If Person A rolled a 4 or above, Person B describes what their action succeeding looks like. Else, they describe what goes wrong. Then they describe their own action and roll the die. 
4. Person A describes success/failure for Person B.
5. Next round repeating all these steps, but switching who goes first.

We play to different end conditions. Sometimes we play to whoever laughs first loses, other times we just try to achieve a satisfying ending. It really depends how goofy we're feeling.
